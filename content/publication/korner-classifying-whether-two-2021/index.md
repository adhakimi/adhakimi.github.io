abstract: To ease the difficulty of argument stance classification, the task of same
  side stance classification (S3C) has been proposed. In contrast to actual stance
  classification, which requires a substantial amount of domain knowledge to identify
  whether an argument is in favor or against a certain issue, it is argued that, for
  S3C, only argument similarity within stances needs to be learned to successfully
  solve the task. We evaluate several transformer-based approaches on the dataset
  of the recent S3C shared task, followed by an in-depth evaluation and error analysis
  of our model and the task's hypothesis. We show that, although we achieve state-of-the-art
  results, our model fails to generalize both within as well as across topics and
  domains when adjusting the sampling strategy of the training and test set to a more
  adversarial scenario. Our evaluation shows that current state-of-the-art approaches
  cannot determine same side stance by considering only domain-independent linguistic
  similarity features, but appear to require domain knowledge and semantic inference,
  too.
