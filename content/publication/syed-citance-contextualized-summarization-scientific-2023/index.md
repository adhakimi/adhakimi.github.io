abstract: Current approaches to automatic summarization of scientific papers generate
  informative summaries in the form of abstracts. However, abstracts are not intended
  to show the relationship between a paper and the references cited in it. We propose
  a new contextualized summarization approach that can generate an informative summary
  conditioned on a given sentence containing the citation of a reference (a so-called
  \"citance\"). This summary outlines the content of the cited paper relevant to the
  citation location. Thus, our approach extracts and models the citances of a paper,
  retrieves relevant passages from cited papers, and generates abstractive summaries
  tailored to each citance. We evaluate our approach using $textbfWebis-Context-SciSumm-2023$,
  a new dataset containing 540K~computer science papers and 4.6M~citances therein.
