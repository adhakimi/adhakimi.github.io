abstract: Detecting references and similarities in music lyrics can be a difficult
  task. Crowdsourced knowledge platforms such as Genius. can help in this process
  through user-annotated information about the artist and the song but fail to include
  visualizations to help users find similarities and structures on a higher and more
  abstract level. We propose a prototype to compute similarities between rap artists
  based on word embedding of their lyrics crawled from Genius. Furthermore, the artists
  and their lyrics can be analyzed using an explorative visualization system applying
  multiple visualization methods to support domain-specific tasks.
