abstract: Two different perspectives on argumentation have been pursued in computer
  science research, namely approaches of argument mining in natural language processing
  on the one hand, and formal argument evaluation on the other hand. So far these
  research areas are largely independent and unrelated. This article introduces the
  agenda of our recently started project ``FAME -- A~framework for argument mining
  and evaluation''. The main project idea is to link the two perspectives on argumentation
  and their respective research agendas by employing controlled natural language as
  a~convenient form of intermediate knowledge representation. Our goal is to develop
  a~framework which integrates argument mining and formal argument evaluation to study
  patterns of empirical argumentation usage. If successful, this combination will
  allow for new types of queries to be answered by argumentation retrieval systems
  and large-scale content analysis. Moreover, feeding evaluation results as additional
  knowledge input to argument mining processes could be utilized to further improve
  their results.
