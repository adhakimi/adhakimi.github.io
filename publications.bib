  abstract = {Two different perspectives on argumentation have been pursued in computer science research, namely approaches of argument mining in natural language processing on the one hand, and formal argument evaluation on the other hand. So far these research areas are largely independent and unrelated. This article introduces the agenda of our recently started project ``FAME -- A~framework for argument mining and evaluation''. The main project idea is to link the two perspectives on argumentation and their respective research agendas by employing controlled natural language as a~convenient form of intermediate knowledge representation. Our goal is to develop a~framework which integrates argument mining and formal argument evaluation to study patterns of empirical argumentation usage. If successful, this combination will allow for new types of queries to be answered by argumentation retrieval systems and large-scale content analysis. Moreover, feeding evaluation results as additional knowledge input to argument mining processes could be utilized to further improve their results.},

  abstract = {We introduce and study a problem variant of sentiment analysis, namely the ``same sentiment classification problem'', where, given a pair of texts, the task is to determine if they have the same sentiment, disregarding the actual sentiment polarity. Among other things, our goal is to enable a more topic-agnostic sentiment classification. We study the problem using the Yelp business review dataset, demonstrating how sentiment data needs to be prepared for this task, and then carry out sequence pair classification using the BERT language model. In a series of experiments, we achieve an accuracy above 83\% for category subsets across topics, and 89\% on average.},

  abstract = {To ease the difficulty of argument stance classification, the task of same side stance classification (S3C) has been proposed. In contrast to actual stance classification, which requires a substantial amount of domain knowledge to identify whether an argument is in favor or against a certain issue, it is argued that, for S3C, only argument similarity within stances needs to be learned to successfully solve the task. We evaluate several transformer-based approaches on the dataset of the recent S3C shared task, followed by an in-depth evaluation and error analysis of our model and the task's hypothesis. We show that, although we achieve state-of-the-art results, our model fails to generalize both within as well as across topics and domains when adjusting the sampling strategy of the training and test set to a more adversarial scenario. Our evaluation shows that current state-of-the-art approaches cannot determine same side stance by considering only domain-independent linguistic similarity features, but appear to require domain knowledge and semantic inference, too.},

Crowdsourced knowledge platforms such as Genius. can help in this process through user-annotated information about the artist and the song but fail to include visualizations to help users find similarities and structures on a higher and more abstract level. We propose a prototype to compute similarities between rap artists based on word embedding of their lyrics crawled from Genius. Furthermore, the artists and their lyrics can be analyzed using an explorative visualization system applying multiple visualization methods to support domain-specific tasks.},

  abstract = {Current approaches to automatic summarization of scientific papers generate informative summaries in the form of abstracts. However, abstracts are not intended to show the relationship between a paper and the references cited in it. We propose a new contextualized summarization approach that can generate an informative summary conditioned on a given sentence containing the citation of a reference (a so-called "citance"). This summary outlines the content of the cited paper relevant to the citation location. Thus, our approach extracts and models the citances of a paper, retrieves relevant passages from cited papers, and generates abstractive summaries tailored to each citance. We evaluate our approach using \${\textbackslash}textbf\{Webis-Context-SciSumm-2023\}\$, a new dataset containing 540K{\textasciitilde}computer science papers and 4.6M{\textasciitilde}citances therein.},
